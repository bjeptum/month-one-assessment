I was unable to complete the assignment due to an unexpected suspension of my AWS account, which occurred because my account details could not be verified.
AWS requested additional information to complete the verification process; however, I currently do not have all the necessary banking or payment details required. 
I am actively working to resolve this matter by following AWS’s instructions and exploring available options to restore access as soon as possible. 
Once my account is reactivated, I will be able to continue and complete the assignment.
